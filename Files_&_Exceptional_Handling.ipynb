        "'''The choice between **multithreading** and **multiprocessing** depends on the nature of the problem you're solving, the tasks you want to perform, and the resources available on the system. Both techniques allow for concurrent execution of code, but they are optimized for different use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Multithreading** vs **Multiprocessing**: Key Differences\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multithreading**:\n",
        "  - Involves running multiple threads within a single process.\n",
        "  - Threads share the same memory space and can communicate easily using shared variables or data structures.\n",
        "  - Suitable for I/O-bound tasks, where the bottleneck is waiting for input/output operations (e.g., disk reads/writes, network requests).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multiprocessing**:\n",
        "  - Involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "  - Processes are isolated from each other and do not share memory directly, which can reduce the risk of issues like race conditions.\n",
        "  - Suitable for CPU-bound tasks, where the bottleneck is computational power.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Scenarios where Multithreading is Preferable:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **I/O-Bound Tasks**:\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Reading and writing files, making network requests, interacting with databases, etc.\n",
        "   - In these cases, the program spends more time waiting for external resources (disk, network, etc.) than performing CPU-intensive work. During this waiting time, other threads can run, improving overall performance without being held up by I/O delays.\n",
        "   - **Why Multithreading Works**: Since threads in a process share the same memory, switching between them is faster, and you don’t need to worry about heavy inter-process communication overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**: A web scraper making many HTTP requests. While one thread waits for a response from a server, another can make a request, avoiding idle time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **UI Applications**:\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Desktop apps, games, or any program with a graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
        "   - **Why Multithreading Works**: In GUI applications, the main thread usually handles user interaction and rendering, while background threads can handle long-running tasks like file loading or network communication. This prevents the UI from freezing.\n",
        "   - **Threading Model**: Some GUI frameworks require or recommend multithreading to keep the interface responsive.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Lightweight Parallelism**:\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Running a few lightweight tasks concurrently, such as processing a small set of files or performing some network processing.\n",
        "   - **Why Multithreading Works**: If the task isn’t computationally intensive, the overhead of creating multiple processes is unnecessary, and threads can efficiently handle these tasks without the need for multiprocessing overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Scenarios where Multiprocessing is Preferable:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **CPU-Bound Tasks**:\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Complex mathematical computations, image processing, machine learning model training, data analytics (e.g., processing large datasets), or simulations that require heavy number crunching.\n",
        "   - **Why Multiprocessing Works**: Python (and many other languages) uses Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes in parallel. Therefore, for CPU-bound tasks, **multiprocessing** can run processes in parallel on different cores of the CPU, fully utilizing multiple CPU cores. Each process has its own memory space, so there is no GIL contention.\n",
        "   - **Example**: A program that performs matrix multiplications or deep learning model training might benefit greatly from multiple processes running on different CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Avoiding the GIL in Python**:\n",
        "   - **Why Multiprocessing Works**: The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in CPython (the standard Python implementation) limits the execution of threads to one at a time in a single process. This means that even if you use multiple threads, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. Multiprocessing sidesteps this limitation by using multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Running a set of parallel tasks like rendering a 3D animation or processing large sets of data that involve intensive mathematical computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Task Isolation and Fault Tolerance**:\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Tasks where failures in one part of the program shouldn't affect the entire system, such as running separate tasks that perform computations on sensitive data, or handling large, independent batches of data.\n",
        "   - **Why Multiprocessing Works**: Processes are isolated from each other, so if one process crashes, it doesn’t affect others. This is particularly useful when you want to isolate different parts of a program for safety or fault tolerance.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Processing independent jobs in a distributed system or in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Parallelizing Heavy Computation Across Multiple Machines**:\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Distributed computing tasks or parallel processing in cloud computing environments.\n",
        "   - **Why Multiprocessing Works**: Each process runs independently, so you can distribute these processes across multiple machines or nodes in a cluster. This is particularly useful when the computation is too large to fit into the memory of a single machine or when the workload is very computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **When Not to Use Multithreading or Multiprocessing**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Shared State Complexity**:\n",
        "   - Both threading and multiprocessing require careful management of shared state.\n",
        "   - **Threading**: Since threads share memory, synchronizing access to shared variables (e.g., using locks, semaphores) can be complex and error-prone.\n",
        "   - **Multiprocessing**: While processes don't share memory directly, inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like queues or shared memory can be used, but they may add complexity and overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Overhead Costs**:\n",
        "   - **Multithreading**: Thread management is lightweight, but excessive threading (e.g., creating a thread for each small task) can lead to performance degradation due to context switching.\n",
        "   - **Multiprocessing**: Creating a process is heavier than creating a thread, and there is added complexity in managing multiple processes and data sharing. Too many processes could lead to inefficient resource usage and memory overhead.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Multithreading** is best for tasks where you need lightweight concurrency and when the tasks are mostly waiting for external resources (e.g., I/O operations). It's also preferred when the program must remain responsive, such as in GUI applications or when handling a lot of small concurrent tasks.\n",

        "#2. Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
        "'''A **process pool** is a programming construct that allows you to manage a collection of worker processes that can be reused to perform tasks concurrently, making it easier to manage multiple processes efficiently. Rather than creating and destroying processes repeatedly (which is an expensive operation), a process pool maintains a set of pre-initialized processes that can be reused for multiple tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of a Process Pool:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Worker Processes**: A pool consists of multiple worker processes, each capable of executing tasks concurrently. These processes are created upfront and remain alive, waiting for tasks to be assigned to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Task Assignment**: Tasks are submitted to the pool, and the pool assigns the tasks to available worker processes. If there are more tasks than worker processes, some tasks may wait in a queue until a process becomes available.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Task Execution**: Once a worker process becomes available, it picks up a task, performs the task, and then becomes ready to take on another task.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Task Results**: When a worker process completes its task, it returns the result (if any) to the main program or the task's originator. The process can then be reused for new tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Benefits of Using a Process Pool**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reduced Overhead from Process Creation**:\n",
        "   - Creating new processes can be slow and resource-intensive, especially when tasks are short-lived or when you have many tasks to run. A process pool eliminates this overhead by reusing a fixed number of worker processes that are pre-created and kept running.\n",
        "   - Instead of constantly creating and destroying processes, you use a fixed set of processes, which improves performance, especially for I/O-bound and CPU-bound workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Efficient Resource Management**:\n",
        "   - A process pool allows you to control the maximum number of concurrent processes running at any given time. This helps prevent overwhelming the system with too many processes (which can consume too much CPU or memory), and it ensures that resources are used efficiently.\n",
        "   - For example, if your system has 8 CPU cores, you may choose to limit the pool size to 8 to ensure that all cores are used without overloading the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scalability**:\n",
        "   - Process pools allow you to scale up the number of concurrent tasks easily by adjusting the pool size. If you need more parallelism, you can increase the size of the pool to accommodate more tasks concurrently (within the system's resource limits).\n",
        "   - Conversely, if there are fewer tasks to run, you can reduce the pool size to conserve resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Simplified Task Management**:\n",
        "   - Using a process pool abstracts away the details of creating, managing, and destroying individual processes. The pool automatically handles task distribution, process management, and error handling, making it easier to work with multiple concurrent processes.\n",
        "   - This abstraction can make your code simpler, cleaner, and less error-prone.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Avoiding Blocking**:\n",
        "   - When you use a process pool, the main program doesn't have to wait for individual processes to complete before moving on to other tasks. This is particularly useful when you have many independent tasks that can be executed concurrently. You can submit all tasks to the pool and then collect the results later, which helps avoid blocking the main program.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Fault Tolerance**:\n",
        "   - If one worker process crashes or encounters an error, other processes in the pool can continue running, providing some level of fault tolerance. The pool may also be configured to restart failed tasks, depending on the implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How a Process Pool Works in Practice:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the `multiprocessing` module provides the `Pool` class, which is a common way to work with process pools. Here's a basic example of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from multiprocessing import Pool\n",
        "\n",
        "# Define a simple function that we want to run in parallel\n",
        "def square(n):\n",
        "    return n * n\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a process pool with 4 worker processes\n",
        "with Pool(4) as pool:\n",
        "    # Map a list of values to the square function across the pool\n",
        "    result = pool.map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])\n",
        "\n",
        "print(result)  # Output will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Process Pool Example Breakdown**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pool Creation**: We create a pool of 4 worker processes (`Pool(4)`).\n",
        "- **Task Distribution**: We use `pool.map()` to apply the `square()` function to a list of numbers. The pool divides the list and assigns chunks of work to the available processes.\n",
        "- **Task Execution**: Each process computes the square of its assigned numbers concurrently.\n",
        "- **Result Collection**: Once all tasks are completed, `pool.map()` returns the results in the same order as the input list.\n",
        "- **Context Manager (`with` statement)**: The `with` statement ensures that the pool is properly closed after the tasks are completed, freeing any resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Advanced Features of Process Pools**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Asynchronous Task Execution**: The `Pool` class also provides methods like `apply_async()` and `map_async()` for running tasks asynchronously, allowing you to submit tasks and continue executing other code without waiting for them to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from multiprocessing import Pool\n",
        "\n",
        "   def square(n):\n",
        "       return n * n\n",
        "\n",
        "   with Pool(4) as pool:\n",
        "       # Asynchronous task execution\n",
        "       result = pool.apply_async(square, (5,))\n",
        "       print(result.get())  # Output: 25\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Custom Initialization**: You can customize how worker processes are initialized using the `initializer` argument. This is useful for setting up shared resources, like database connections, that need to be available to each worker.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error Handling**: Process pools handle errors gracefully. If a worker process raises an exception, the pool can report it back to the main program or retry the task, depending on the configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Task Queues**: Some process pool implementations provide task queues that allow tasks to be added to a queue, which workers fetch and process. This is useful for situations where tasks arrive dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Use Cases for Process Pools**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Batch Processing**: When you need to process large amounts of data in parallel, such as image or video processing, data transformation, or simulations, a process pool can divide the work efficiently.\n",
        "- **Parallel Computation**: If you have CPU-bound tasks like mathematical computations (e.g., simulations, scientific computing), process pools can take full advantage of multiple CPU cores, bypassing the GIL in Python.\n",
        "- **Web Crawling**: A pool can be used to manage multiple processes that scrape web pages concurrently, making it more efficient than spawning new processes for each request.\n",
        "- **Distributed Systems**: In distributed systems or high-performance computing (HPC) environments, process pools can help manage computation tasks across multiple machines or processors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "A **process pool** is a highly effective way to manage concurrent tasks in a system that uses multiple processes. It reduces the overhead of process creation, optimizes resource usage, improves scalability, and simplifies task management, making it an ideal choice for managing multiple processes in scenarios with high concurrency or parallelism.

        "**Multiprocessing** is a method of running multiple processes concurrently on a computer. In a multiprocessing model, each process runs independently and has its own memory space. In contrast to **multithreading**, where threads share memory within a single process, multiprocessing uses separate processes with their own memory, which allows them to run independently without interference.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Thread Management**:\n",
        "   - The threads are started with `thread_add.start()` and `thread_remove.start()`.\n",

        "'''### Why It's Crucial to Handle Exceptions in Concurrent Programs\n",
        "\n",
        "In concurrent programming, where multiple threads or processes execute simultaneously, managing exceptions becomes particularly critical due to the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unpredictable Execution Flow**:\n",
        "   - In a multithreaded or multiprocess environment, multiple threads or processes may be executing different parts of the program at the same time. An exception in one thread/process can have a different impact depending on how the threads or processes are scheduled and interact with each other. If an exception is not handled properly, it could cause the entire program to crash or leave the system in an inconsistent state.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Resource Management**:\n",
        "   - Concurrent programs often share resources like memory, file handles, or network connections. If an exception occurs and the resource is not properly released, it could lead to resource leaks, which can degrade performance or cause deadlocks. Proper exception handling ensures resources are cleaned up correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fault Isolation**:\n",
        "   - In multithreaded or multiprocess programs, one thread/process can fail without affecting others if the exception is handled appropriately. Failure to do so could lead to cascading failures where the failure of one part of the system causes the whole system to crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Concurrency Issues**:\n",
        "   - Concurrency introduces unique challenges like race conditions and deadlocks. If an exception is not handled correctly, these issues might not be detected immediately, and the program might continue running in a corrupted state, leading to difficult-to-debug issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Graceful Shutdown or Recovery**:\n",
        "   - If a concurrent operation fails, you may want to either recover from it gracefully or shut down the program without leaving it in an inconsistent state. Without proper exception handling, errors can go unnoticed, leading to unpredictable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Techniques for Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides various tools and techniques to handle exceptions in concurrent programs, especially when dealing with threads and processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Exception Handling in Threads**\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with **multithreading**, exceptions can arise in individual threads. You need to ensure that exceptions in one thread don't crash the entire program, and that errors are reported in a controlled manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **a) Handling Exceptions in Threads using `try-except` Block**\n",
        "\n",
        "Each thread in Python runs independently, so any exception that occurs inside a thread won't propagate to the main thread or other threads. To handle exceptions inside a thread, you can use a `try-except` block within the target function.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import threading\n",
        "\n",
        "def thread_function():\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        # Code that might raise an exception\n",
        "        x = 1 / 0  # Deliberate ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "    except Exception as e:\n",
        "        print(f\"Exception occurred in thread: {e}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create and start the thread\n",
        "thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)\n",
        "thread.start()\n",
        "thread.join()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the exception inside `thread_function` is caught and handled, so it doesn't cause the thread to crash. The main program will continue execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **b) Catching Exceptions from Threads (via `threading.Thread` Exception Handling)**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you need to catch exceptions in a thread from the main thread or handle the exception outside of the thread, one common approach is to pass an exception object or a status indicator (e.g., a `queue.Queue`) back to the main thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import threading\n",
        "import queue\n",
        "\n",
        "def thread_function(q):\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        # Code that might raise an exception\n",
        "        result = 1 / 0\n",
        "        q.put(result)  # Put result into queue if no exception\n",
        "    except Exception as e:\n",
        "        q.put(f\"Exception: {e}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "q = queue.Queue()\n",
        "thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(q,))\n",
        "thread.start()\n",
        "thread.join()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Get the result or exception from the queue\n",
        "print(q.get())  # Will print \"Exception: division by zero\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we use a `queue.Queue` to safely pass the exception message back to the main thread. The main thread can then handle it, for example, by logging it or showing an error message to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **c) Using `threading.Event` or `threading.Condition` for Error Signaling**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use a `threading.Event` or `threading.Condition` to signal errors between threads, especially in more complex situations where multiple threads need to handle the same error condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Exception Handling in Processes**\n",
        "\n",
        "With **multiprocessing**, processes are isolated from each other and run in their own memory space. Exceptions that occur in one process do not propagate to other processes or the main process. Handling exceptions in a multiprocessing environment requires capturing the exceptions and communicating them back to the main process.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **a) Using `multiprocessing.Queue` to Report Exceptions**\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like with threading, one way to handle exceptions in multiprocessing is to use a `Queue` to report the exception from the worker process back to the main process.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "def worker(q):\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        # Code that might raise an exception\n",
        "        result = 1 / 0  # Deliberate ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "        q.put(result)  # Put result in queue\n",
        "    except Exception as e:\n",
        "        q.put(f\"Exception: {e}\")  # Put exception message in queue\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "    q = multiprocessing.Queue()\n",
        "    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(q,))\n",
        "    p.start()\n",
        "    p.join()\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Retrieve result or exception from the queue\n",
        "    print(q.get())  # Will print \"Exception: division by zero\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **b) Using `multiprocessing.Pool` for Error Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "When using a process pool (e.g., `multiprocessing.Pool`), exceptions that occur in worker processes are captured and can be accessed via the `apply_async` method or when using `map`/`map_async`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "def worker(n):\n",
        "    if n == 0:\n",
        "        raise ValueError(\"Zero is not allowed!\")\n",
        "    return 10 / n\n",
        "\n",
        "def handle_result(result):\n",
        "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
        "\n",
        "def handle_exception(exception):\n",
        "    print(\"Exception:\", exception)\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
        "    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
        "        results = []\n",
        "        for n in [5, 0, 2, 4]:\n",
        "            result = pool.apply_async(worker, (n,), error_callback=handle_exception, callback=handle_result)\n",
        "            results.append(result)\n",
        "\n",
        "        # Wait for all results to complete\n",
        "        for result in results:\n",
        "            result.wait()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- The `apply_async` method runs the worker function asynchronously and provides two callbacks:\n",
        "  - `callback` handles the result when the task is successful.\n",
        "  - `error_callback` handles any exceptions raised by the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **c) Using `multiprocessing.Manager` for Shared Exception Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "In more complex scenarios, you might want to store and share exceptions across processes using `multiprocessing.Manager`. This is particularly useful when you want to keep track of all exceptions that occur in a set of processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import multiprocessing\n",

        "    except Exception as e:\n",
        "        shared_exceptions.append(str(e))  # Append exception to shared list\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "    with multiprocessing.Manager() as manager:\n",
        "        shared_exceptions = manager.list()  # Shared list to store exceptions\n",
        "        processes = []\n",
        "\n",
        "        for _ in range(5):\n",
        "            p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(shared_exceptions,))\n",
        "            processes.append(p)\n",
        "            p.start()\n",
        "\n",
        "        for p in processes:\n",
        "            p.join()\n",
        "\n",
        "        print(\"Exceptions encountered:\", list(shared_exceptions))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we use `Manager().list()` to create a shared list where each process can store exceptions it encounters. After all processes finish, the main process can review the collected exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **General Exception Handling Strategies**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Try-Except Blocks**: Use `try-except` blocks around critical code to catch and handle exceptions within threads or processes.\n",
        "- **Error Callbacks**: In `multiprocessing.Pool` or `concurrent.futures`, use error callbacks to handle exceptions raised by worker functions.\n",
        "- **Centralized Logging**: For more complex systems, you might want to set up centralized logging mechanisms (e.g., using Python's `logging` module) to capture and track exceptions from multiple threads or processes.\n",
        "- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure that when an exception occurs, your program shuts down gracefully, releasing any acquired resources and saving state if necessary.\n",
        "- **Timeouts and Retries**: For tasks that might fail intermittently, consider using timeouts and retries to handle occasional failures without crashing the whole program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Handling exceptions in concurrent programs is crucial for maintaining stability, ensuring proper resource management, and providing fault tolerance. Whether you're working with threads or processes, Python offers several tools like `Queue`, `Lock`, `Event`, `multiprocessing.Pool`, and `Manager` to manage exceptions effectively. By properly handling exceptions, you can ensure that your program continues running smoothly, even when individual tasks encounter errors.'''"

        "1. **`compute_square` Function**: This function takes a number `n` as input and returns its square (`n * n`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`run_pool_computation` Function**:\n",
        "   - This function takes a `pool_size` argument to specify how many processes to use.\n",
        "   - It creates a `Pool` with the given number of processes using `multiprocessing.Pool(processes=pool_size)`.\n",
        "   - The `pool.map()` method is used to apply the `compute_square` function to each number in the list `numbers` (from 1 to 10).\n",
        "   - It also measures the time taken for the computation using `time.time()` before and after calling `pool.map()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`main` Function**:\n",
        "   - It loops over a list of pool sizes `[2, 4, 8]` and calls `run_pool_computation` for each pool size.\n",
        "   - For each pool size, it prints the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10 and the time taken for the computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**: This is used to ensure that the program runs correctly when using the `multiprocessing` module, as it prevents unwanted code execution when the program is run in parallel processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "When you run the program, it will print the squares of numbers from 1 to 10 and the time taken for each pool size.\n",

        "### Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`multiprocessing.Pool`**: The `Pool` class provides a convenient way to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple processes. The `map()` method is used to apply a function to a list of inputs and distribute the work across the pool of processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Timing**: We use `time.time()` to measure the elapsed time for computation. This helps us understand how the performance scales with different pool sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pool Size and Performance**: The program measures how the execution time varies with different pool sizes (2, 4, 8 processes). In many cases, using more processes can speed up computations by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores, though there's a limit beyond which adding more processes may not improve performance significantly due to overhead and resource contention.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Factors Affecting Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Number of CPU Cores**: If the machine has fewer CPU cores than the pool size, using more processes won't necessarily speed up the computation and may even introduce overhead.\n",
        "- **Task Complexity**: For very simple tasks like squaring numbers, the overhead of creating and managing processes may outweigh the benefits of parallelization. For more computationally expensive tasks, larger pool sizes can yield better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "This program provides a simple way to benchmark how multiprocessing scales with different pool sizes and gives a practical example of how to use `multiprocessing.Pool` for parallel computations.'''"
